## what is fork? How processes are created using fork()

```c++
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h> 

int main(){
    printf("1 ... \n");

    fork();

    printf("2 ... \n");

    fork();

    printf("3 ... \n");

    return 0;
}


/* 
1 ... 
2 ... 
3 ... 
2 ... 
3 ... 
3 ... 
3 ...  
 */
```

- when a process call `fork()` (or executes a fork command), it creates a copy of itself
  (a new process is created). The thread of execution id duplicated, creating a child 
  process from the parent process.

```js
1st time: from parent
2nd time: from Child1
3rd time: from parent's new Child2
4th time: from Child1's new Child3
fork();
fork();
```

- the first process will print `1...`
  then there will be 2 processes and both will start executing from that pointï¼Œ hence
  there will be 2 process printing 2

```ruby
2...

2...
```

- Then, both the processes will create one child process each, hence creating total 4
  processes. And each of these 4 processes will print `3...` hence there will be 

```ruby
3...
3...
3...
3...
```

- Hence the complete output will be

```ruby
1 ... 

2 ... 

3 ... 

2 ... 

3 ... 

3 ... 

3 ...  
```


- The important point to understand is that the child process starts its execution
  from the point where it is created(**and not from the start of the program**)

- At the end there will be 4 processes running. 

- Return value of the fork is different for the parent(process creating) and 
  (child process created). And hence the 2 processes can take decisions by oberserving
  the return value of fork command. Return value of fork will be
  - **1**: If unable to create a child process.
  - **0**: 0 is returned to the child process(if it is created).
  - **Process-ID of newly created process:** Process-ID of the newly created process 
    (child process) will be returned to the parent process 
    (In case parent need it for anything)

- Separate address space for the child will be created with exact copy of all the
  memory segments from the parent process. Hence, <u>if the child process want to know
  the process id of parent process then the parent process can store its id in a 
  variable before forking a process.</u> Hence both the processes can have process-ids
  of each other in case they want to interact with each other thru inter process
  commmunication.


- For example:

```c++
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h> 

int main(){
    printf("Start...\n");
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if(pid == -1){
        printf("Unable to create child process\n");  
    }else if(pid == 0){
        printf("Inside Child Process\n");
    }else{
        printf("Inside Parent\n");
    }
}


/* 
Start...
Inside Parent
Inside Child Process
 */
```


- If process creation is successful, then Parent process will output:

```js
Start...

Inside Parent

//and child process will output:

Inside Child Process

```

- Separate address space for the child will be created with exact copy of all the memory 
  segments from the parent process.
